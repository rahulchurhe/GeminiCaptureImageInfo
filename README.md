What is Gemini ? 

The Gemini ecosystem represents Google’s most capable AI. 

Gemini is multimodal and in this blog we will discuss how Android developers can use the Gemini Pro model. 

App development with Gemini Pro 

Gemini Pro is accessible via the Gemini API. To simplify integrating Gemini Pro, you can use the Google AI SDK, a client SDK for Android. 

Latest Android Studio includes a new template for starting the Google AI SDK, a simple method to access the Gemini Api directly in the latest preview version of Android Studio. 

Project Setup 

1. Android Studio -> File -> New Project 
2. “API Key” will be asked after the new project details have been entered. 
3. When you click on “Generate API key” option, it will redirect you on following link : Google AI Studio. 

Get your API key and complete your project setup. 

First Gemini Android App 

Once the setup is finished, you will see that a demo project is created for you. To get started, simply click the “run” button in your Android Studio. And boom! Your first Gemini Android app is successfully created.
